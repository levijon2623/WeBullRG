===========
THE single simulation core. Every backtest in this repo should route through
here so that fixing a fill model fixes it everywhere at once.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
As of 2026-09-10 there were FIVE near-identical candidate builders and TWO
divergent exit simulators in the tree. The newer one modelled the live exit
cushion; the older one did not, and was ~10pp optimistic per trade. The stale
one was still behind `check_book_now` (what the book earns) and
`check_trail_regression` (the per-rule trail-vs-static calls that set
`trail_pct` in config). That is exactly how the original sequential-fill bug
survived for months: two code paths, one quietly wrong, no single place to fix.

THE THREE THINGS THIS GETS RIGHT, ALL LEARNED THE HARD WAY
----------------------------------------------------------
1. SEQUENTIAL FILLS. `bot_runner.py:1288` = `if ticker in self.active_snipes:
   continue` -- the live bot holds AT MOST ONE POSITION PER TICKER. Scoring
   every matched trigger independently inflates trade count ~10x and OOS
   expectancy ~2.5x. `walk()` enforces the real guard.

2. REALISTIC FILLS. Enter at the ASK, exit at the BID. Costs ~10pp book-wide
   versus mid-to-mid, and more for trailing exits, which leave on the way down.

3. THE LIVE EXIT CUSHION (`cushion=True`, the DEFAULT). `bot_runner._fire_exit`
   prices the closing limit at `bid - spread*1.5` on a losing exit and
   `bid - spread*0.5` on a profitable one -- Webull is limit-only for options,
   so the bot must post marketable. Verified against live paper fills on
   2026-09-09: AVGO trail level $0.65 -> exit $0.50 (cushion $0.15 = 1.5 x $0.10
   spread), and $0.975 -> $0.74. Cost 11.5pp and 14.1pp of entry premium.
   Book-wide it takes the deployed trail from OOS +17.4% to +7.1%.

   It is NOT neutral between policies: losing exits pay 3x the cushion, so it
   penalises low-win-rate policies (the trail, win 0.38) harder than
   high-win-rate ones. Any policy comparison run WITHOUT it is biased toward
   whichever policy loses more often.

   NOTE the true fill sits BETWEEN two bounds: DRY_RUN books at the cushioned
   limit (zero price improvement, pessimistic) while a plain-bid sim is
   optimistic. Live is in between. `cushion=False` is kept only to reproduce
   historical numbers, never to make a decision.

WHAT `walk()` ALSO CONTROLS -- and why it belongs here
------------------------------------------------------
The position policy DETERMINES THE SAMPLE, not just the P&L. The guard decides
which triggers become trades; the EXIT decides when the ticker frees up, which
decides which SUBSEQUENT triggers become trades. Measured on identical rules and
triggers: the deployed trail yields 310 trades, a faster exit yields 603. The
book's OOS SIGN changes with the sampling rule (+8.9% as-screened, +7.1%
sequential, -6.1% fast-exit, -12.0% first-trigger-only). So `cap`, `skip` and
`after` live here alongside the exit, because they are the same decision.

    cap    max trades per ticker-day   (None = deployed, unlimited)
    skip   ignore the first N ACTIONABLE triggers per ticker-day. Triggers
           arriving while a position is open are already blocked by the guard
           and do NOT consume the skip budget. NOTE: skipping keeps us FLAT, so
           the next trigger is eligible IMMEDIATELY -- skip=1 is NOT "start at
           trade #2", it builds a different (generally earlier) sequence.
    after  no entry before this minute-of-day

PAYLOAD FORMAT
--------------
    (entry_mid, entry_ask, close[], high[], low[], bid[], ask[], mod[])
An 8-tuple. The legacy 7-tuple (no `ask[]`) is still accepted for backward
compatibility, but cushion modelling is impossible without it and is silently
disabled -- `build_candidates()` always emits the 8-tuple.

#: Fill models, worst-to-best. `bot` MIRRORS bot_runner.
#:
#: bot_runner does NOT pay the ask. It posts
#:     entry_limit = min(round((bid + ask)/2 + 0.01, 2), round(ask, 2))
#: i.e. MID + ONE TICK capped at the ask (bot_runner.py:1416), and exits at
#:     max(0.01, round(bid - spread * (0.5 if taking profit else 1.5), 2))
#: So the live model is ASYMMETRIC: optimistic entry, pessimistic exit. Charging
#: the full ask on entry -- what every sim in this repo did before 2026-09-10 --
#: invents roughly a half-spread of cost per trade, which on a wide 0DTE contract
#: can exceed the edge being measured.
#:
#: THE FILL ASSUMPTION IS NOT A DETAIL. For any ticker whose spread exceeds its
#: measured edge, the assumption DETERMINES THE SIGN of the answer, and picking
#: a price between bid and ask is arbitrary. Use `check_fill_sensitivity.py` to
#: see which conclusions survive the WHOLE BAND rather than trusting one point.
#:
#: CAVEAT on `bot`: DRY_RUN assumes the mid+1 limit fills. On a tight, deep chain
#: (NVDA/SPY 0-1DTE) that matches live experience. On a thin, wide one (SMH ATM
#: 0DTE trades in the hundreds, not thousands) the limit may not fill at all, so
#: the trade is missed or chased. `bot` is therefore an UPPER bound on entry
#: quality for illiquid names; fill-PROBABILITY risk is reported separately as
#: spread/volume, never baked into the P&L.
FILL_MODELS = {
    "mid":    "mid in, mid out (frictionless -- fantasy upper bound)",

    "askbid": "ask in, bid out (no cushion)",
    "worst":  "ask in, bid-1.5xspread out (symmetric-pessimistic lower bound)",
    "botcap": "like `bot`, but the exit cushion is CAPPED at the bid's own "
              "measured intra-minute movement (see CUSHION_CAP)",
}

#: Per-ticker cap on the exit cushion, in spreads. Measured 2026-09-16 from the
#: 2026-09-01..09-15 bronze tape (18.9M prints, dte<=1, mid>=$0.30), which is the
#: first data carrying NBBO depth.
#:
#: WHAT THE MEASUREMENT ACTUALLY SHOWED, because the naive reading is wrong:
#:   * A fill, GIVEN a quote, is nearly free: 86% of small sells print at exactly
#:     the bid, 11.5% better, 2.1% worse; clipped mean cost 0.028 spreads. So the
#:     1.5x cushion is NOT modelling fill slippage.
#:   * What it is really proxying is TRIGGER TIMING. `simulate` evaluates the
#:     trail on a minute-CLOSE bid; the live bot evaluates continuously and exits
#:     on the first intra-minute touch, which in a falling market is worse than
#:     the close. That is a genuine, systematic, one-way cost.
#:   * Within-minute bid dispersion is large (mean 3.90 spreads overall) but it is
#:     SYMMETRIC NOISE and must NOT be added to the cost -- only the adverse half
#:     is real, and its size is not directly observable.
#:
#: The cap below is the physically motivated bound on that timing cost: the bid
#: cannot cost you more than it actually moved, so the charge is limited to half
#: the mean within-minute range.
#:
#: ⚠️ `botcap` IS NOT UNIFORMLY MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN `bot`. An earlier version of
#: this note claimed it was, and that stopped being true once the multiplier was
#: keyed on the exit TAG rather than on profitability. A PROFITABLE trail/stop
#: now pays the cap (e.g. 1.22) where the legacy rule charged 0.5, because the
#: trigger is adverse whether or not the trade is green. So the re-pricing cuts
#: both ways and a rule's direction cannot be assumed from the cap alone.
#: SPY and QQQ are unchanged (their bid moves further than 1.5 spreads anyway);
#: the relief lands on the wide-spread names, where 1.5 spreads was charging
#: 2.4-3.8x the bid's observed movement.
#: A MISSING TICKER IS NOT A NEUTRAL DEFAULT -- `botcap` falls back to the
#: uncapped 1.5 and the rule is silently NOT re-priced. That produced a spurious
#: "+0.0, unchanged" for AMZN/LULU/TSLA on the first disabled-rule sweep, which
#: read as "the cap changes nothing here" when it meant "never measured".
#: Run measure_cushion_cap.py before adding any ticker.
#: MOVED TO config.py (2026-09-18) and re-exported here, so every existing
#: `sim_core.CUSHION_CAP` caller keeps working unchanged. They had to move
#: because bot_runner imports no research module and was therefore still
#: charging the RETIRED 1.5 on every live exit -- on GLD, whose measured cap is
#: 0.40, that priced exits below the floor and booked seven ~-99% fills in one
#: session. A constant the live bot cannot import is a constant that will drift
#: away from the thing it is supposed to govern (METHODOLOGY 1).

#: PRE-SAMPLE HOLDOUT (PRESAMPLE_PLAN.md). Within minutes `check_book_now`
#: silently reported n=336 instead of 297 and an in-sample mean of -1.1%
#: instead of +4.9% -- because it has no date floor, so the holdout landed in
#: its "IS" bucket and contaminated it. Every one of the ~88 scripts here has
#: the same shape, so the floor belongs in the ONE builder they all route
#: through, not in each of them.
#:
#: Pass `since=None` to include the pre-sample window. It was the holdout until
#: `check_presample.py` spent it on 2026-09-12 (PRESAMPLE_PLAN.md 6a); it is now
#: usable only as LABELLED additional in-sample context (METHODOLOGY 8). The
#: default floor stays, so no study picks it up by accident.
