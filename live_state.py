"""
live_state.py
=============
Emits bot_runner's OWN state to a small JSON so flow_viewer.html can render the
live trigger. Read-only with respect to the engine.

🚨 WHY THE BOT EMITS INSTEAD OF THE VIEWER POLLING UW
    The cumulative net-premium series, its EMA(5), the crossover state and the
    live percentile gate already exist in FlowMomentumTracker and
    _live_flow_threshold. A separate process rebuilding them from the UW API
    would be a SECOND IMPLEMENTATION of the trigger -- which is precisely the
    shape of both divergences found on 2026-09-19/20: `strike_offset` honoured
    by bot_runner but not by research, and a stale entry spot in
    build_candidates that moved the selected strike on up to 81% of candidates.
    A chart that disagrees with the bot is worse than no chart, because it will
    be believed. So the numbers come out of the live objects, via
    FlowMomentumTracker.closed_series, and nothing here recomputes a signal.

🚨 THIS RUNS INSIDE A LIVE TRADING LOOP
    Three rules, none of them negotiable:
      1. `tick()` NEVER raises. Every path is inside one try/except that
         swallows and disables on repeat failure. A charting nicety must not be
         able to kill a process holding real positions.
      2. The write is ATOMIC -- temp file plus os.replace -- so the viewer can
         never read a half-written document and the bot never blocks on a
         reader.
      3. It is THROTTLED to once per MIN_INTERVAL seconds. The monitor loop runs
         at 0.1s; writing a file 600 times a minute would be absurd.

WHAT THE VIEWER GETS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT
    Everything here is already in memory, so the emit costs no UW calls and no
    rate limit. Note one real consequence of bot_runner.py:1708
    (`if ticker in self.active_snipes: continue`): while a position is open, the
    scanner skips that ticker entirely, so its flow series STOPS ADVANCING. That
    is reported honestly as state "holding" with a frozen series rather than
    smoothed over -- if the gap matters, the chart is where it will show up.

Usage (bot_runner, once inside the main loop):

# The week's 0-4DTE gamma map for weekly_gex.html (operator design, 2026-09-27).
#
#   * ONE SNAPSHOT PER TICKER PER MORNING, from the first GEX pass at or after
#     09:31 ET whose rows carry TODAY's date -- i.e. built on this morning's
#     open interest and a real opening price. Open interest only changes
#     overnight, so a snapshot is a map of where the day's levels STARTED;
#     the heat on the main chart is the intraday one.
#   * Each snapshot covers every REMAINING expiry of the week (today..Friday,
#     holidays removed via market_calendar.trading_days). An expiry's
#     column therefore freezes at the snapshot of its own expiry morning, and
#     elapsed days stay drawn until the week ends.
#   * EVERY snapshot is kept -- Monday's view of Friday, Tuesday's view of
#     Friday... -- so the page can show how a level migrated. A new ISO week
#     starts a new file; the old one stays in live/weekly_gex/ as an archive.
#     Those archives are the only look-ahead-free record of weekly levels:
#     UW's historical GEX is built on that session's FINAL open interest
#     (see _log_levels), so it cannot be reconstructed later.
#   * Costs no extra requests: built from _GEX_NEAR, which _fetch_gex already
#     paged. The price line is sampled from _PX.
#   * SESSION OHLC per day (RTH open / high / low / close, drawn in each
#     elapsed day's column) comes from the 1m bars the VWAP thread already
#     fetches every 2 minutes (_weekly_session) -- true highs and lows, not
#     5-minute closes. A day is marked FINAL by a pass at or after 16:02 ET;
#     the VWAP thread polls until 16:05, so that normally happens the same
#     afternoon. BACKSTOP: a day left unfinal (bot down at the close) is
#     fetched once from ohlc/1m by the next trading day's pass -- and for the
#     week's LAST day, which has no next day in its own week, by the first
#     pass of the following week, written into the archived file. One
#     request per ticker-day, only when needed. Half days need no special
#     case: a fetch after the day ends returns the whole shortened session.

    🚨 WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM _closed_px RATHER THAN FOLDED INTO IT.
    Dropping the forming minute is what made the price line trail the market
    by up to a minute (median ~30s) while the `spot` readout beside it was
    current -- the chart and the number disagreed, which is exactly the kind
    of divergence this codebase keeps getting bitten by.

    But the flow series and its EMA MUST stay closed-only: the trigger is
    defined on closed-minute cumulative flow and the backtest computes it
    that way. So the fix is not to relax _closed_px -- it is to ship the
    forming point separately, let the PRICE line reach the present, and leave
    the flow pane on the grid the trigger actually uses. A line series has no
    OHLC to be wrong about; a forming point is just "the price now".

    🚨 STAMPED AT NOW, NOT AT THE MINUTE BOUNDARY.
    Closed points are stamped at their minute's START, which is correct for
    them but means the drawn right edge sits 60-120s behind the market
    (measured 96s on 2026-09-24 at 15:00:36, last point 14:59). The forming
    value is whatever _sample_price last read -- at most MIN_INTERVAL old --
    so stamping it at the current second puts the line where the price
    actually is. It lands off the minute grid on purpose; the flow pane keeps
    its own grid because the trigger lives there.
