manual_orders.py
================
Discretionary orders fired from flow_viewer, executed by bot_runner.

🚨 THE VIEWER NEVER PLACES AN ORDER. It writes a REQUEST file; bot_runner picks
it up, validates it and executes. That is deliberate:
  - only one process ever holds Webull credentials or an order connection
  - the marketable-limit convention, the allocator and the ledger stay in ONE
    place instead of being reimplemented in a web handler
  - the resulting position lives in bot_runner's memory, so the EOD flatten and
    the entry block work on it automatically rather than by remembering to

🚨 ARMING IS SEPARATE FROM DRY_RUN, ON PURPOSE
    `DRY_RUN` means "the BOT sends nothing". If manual orders rode on it, the
    startup banner would read `DRY_RUN = True` while real orders were leaving
    the machine -- and that banner is exactly what you check to confirm you are
    safe. `MANUAL_TRADING_ARMED` is independent, defaults False, and is echoed
    into live/state.json so the chart and the engine can never disagree.

POSITION HANDLING -- chosen by the user 2026-09-22
    Manual fills are NOT adopted into the bot's bracket logic: no trail, no
    stop. Two things are enforced anyway:
      1. AN ENTRY BLOCK. `active_snipes` is what the scanner's guard keys on,
         so without this the bot would happily open its own IWM position on top
         of a manual one and double the exposure.
      2. AN EOD FLATTEN, which TRUMPS "unmanaged". A 0DTE with no stop that is
         simply forgotten expires worthless; the user has done it before. This
         is the one exit that protects against absence rather than price.

VALIDATION, all of it before anything is sent
    armed · known contract with a live quote · qty and premium caps · a price
    collar against the live mid, so a stale quote cannot fill something absurd.

# for that exact (ticker, direction) pair -- there is no SPY/QQQ/IWM PUT rule,
# so the scanner hits `if not trade_rules: continue` and the extra contracts
# sit in memory unused. They cost MQTT subscriptions (~25 more) and nothing

    discretionary position opened deliberately in the broker app: starting the
    bot would sell it out from under you. Adopting instead gives the position
    everything a viewer-placed one gets:
      · the entry block, so the bot will not stack its own trade on top
      · the 15:55 EOD flatten
      · live P&L and the exit buttons in the viewer

    the trail, CUSHION_CAP, EXIT_FLOOR_FRAC, the fill behaviour sim_core

    silently change the thing that was measured. Never bracket active_snipes.
